# Waza: Engineering Skills Dispatcher

Prefix your first line with 🥷 inline, not as its own paragraph.

**Update check (non-blocking).** Once per conversation, run `bash <skill-base-dir>/scripts/check-update.sh` with `<skill-base-dir>` replaced by this skill's base directory; if it prints a line, relay it to the user, then continue. If it already ran in this conversation, or the script is missing or errors, skip silently without retrying or mentioning it. It checks at most once a day, only reads a public version file, and sends no data.

You have eight skills available. Match the user's intent to the right skill, read the matching section below, and execute it.

## Routing Table

<!-- routing-table:start -->
| Intent | Skill | File |
|--------|-------|------|
| Code review, before merge, release gates, generated artifacts, safety sinks, publish/push/reaction follow-through, triage issues/PRs, project-wide code-quality audit scorecard | check | `skills/check/SKILL.md` |
| Codex/Claude/Pi ignoring instructions, agent config audit, hooks/MCP broken, health token usage, AI coding code rot, hotspot ownership, unclear context, missing verification, stale verifier output | health | `skills/health/SKILL.md` |
| Error, crash, regression, screenshot-reported defect, test failure, stale cache, runtime boundary, why broken | hunt | `skills/hunt/SKILL.md` |
| Deep research, unfamiliar domain, compile sources into output | learn | `skills/learn/SKILL.md` |
| Any URL or PDF to fetch, read this, fetch this page | read | `skills/read/SKILL.md` |
| New feature, architecture, how should I design this, value judgment, executable plan, handoff | think | `skills/think/SKILL.md` |
| UI, component, page, visual interface, frontend, artifact-grounded screenshot aesthetic complaint | ui | `skills/ui/SKILL.md` |
| Writing, editing prose, polish, release notes, launch/social copy, remove AI tone | write | `skills/write/SKILL.md` |
<!-- routing-table:end -->

## How This Works

1. Read the user's message and match it to a skill from the table above.
2. Read the matched skill section in full.
3. Execute that skill's instructions exactly.

If the message could match multiple skills, use these disambiguation rules:

1. Most specific wins: `/ui` is more specific than `/think` for UI decisions.
2. URL in message: start with `/read`. If the content is research material, chain to `/learn`.
3. Code already done vs. code broken: done/PR -> `/check`; error/broken -> `/hunt`.
4. Config/maintainability vs. code: Codex/Claude misbehaving, hooks/MCP, `/health` token usage, AI coding code rot, unclear context, missing verification, or stale verifier output -> `/health`; user code errors -> `/hunt`.
5. Release action vs. release prose: commit/tag/publish/push/release reactions/close issue -> `/check`; write release notes/changelog text -> `/write`.
6. Screenshot taste vs. screenshot regression: visual taste complaint -> `/ui`; broken render/state/generated output or used-to-work evidence -> `/hunt`.
7. From scratch vs. editing: new long-form output -> `/learn`; existing draft to polish -> `/write`.
8. "Judge this" + error -> `/hunt`; "judge this" + should we keep it -> `/think`.
9. Still ambiguous: read both skills' "Not for" sections; use exclusion. If still unclear, ask the user.

## Path Resolution

In this distribution, sub-skill scripts live at `skills/{name}/scripts/`. Resolve all relative paths from this file's directory, not from a personal home-directory skill cache.

## Chaining

Skills chain manually, not automatically. Each skill completes and waits for the user's next action.

Common chains: `/think` -> implement approved plan -> `/check` | `/hunt` -> fix -> `/check` -> release/push/issue follow-through | `/read` -> `/learn` -> `/write`
